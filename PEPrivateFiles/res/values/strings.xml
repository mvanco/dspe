    <string name="about_title">Policy Enforcement Project</string>
    <string name="about_text">This work deals with the concepts of Android security and proposes the system for dynamic enforcement of access rights. Each suspicious application can be repackaged by this system, so that the access to selected private data is restricted for the outer world. In the first phase, interprocess communication and existing frameworks, which are capable to intercept communication between application and the operating system on the level of system calls, are explored. After that, the system is designed and developed, utilizing the possibilities of one of the compared frameworks â€“ Aurasium framework. The system adds an innovative approach of tracking the information flows from the privacy-sensitive sources using tainting mechanism without need of administrator rights. There has been designed file-level and data-level taint propagation and policy enforcement based on Android binder.</string>
